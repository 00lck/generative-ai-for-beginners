# Generative AI for Beginners - A Course 

Learn the fundamentals of building Generative AI applications with our 12-lesson comprehensive course by Microsoft Cloud Advocates. Each lesson covers a key aspect of Generative AI principles and application development. Throughout this course, we will be building our own Generative AI startup so you can get an understanding of what it takes to launch your ideas. 

## üå± Getting Started

To get started, [fork this entire repo](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/fork) to your own GitHub account to be able to change any code and complete the challenges. You can also [star (üåü) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) to find it easier later!  

Head to the [Course Setup Page](/00-course-setup/README.md) to find the setup guide that works best for you!

## üó£Ô∏è Meet Other Learners, Get Support 

We believe one of the best ways to learn is learning with others! Join our [official AI Discord server](https://aka.ms/genai-discord) to meet and network with other learners taking this course and get support. Who knows? You might find your next co-founder there! 

### üöÄ  Are you a startup or got an idea you want to launch? 

Visit [Microsoft's Founders Hub](https://aka.ms/genai-foundershub) where you can apply to receive **free OpenAI credits** and up to **$150k towards Azure's leading AI services**. 

## üìÇ Each lesson includes:

- a short video introdution to the topic
- written lesson located in the README 
- for project-based lessons, a Juypter Notebook with code examples 
- a challenge or assignment to apply your learning 
- links to extra resources to contiune your learning
