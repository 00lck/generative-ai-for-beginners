# Generative AI for Beginners - A Course 

Learn the fundamentals of building Generative AI applications with our 12-lesson comprehensive course by Microsoft Cloud Advocates. Each lesson covers a key aspect of Generative AI principles and application development. This course will take you from learning Generative AI concepts like LLMs and prompt engineering to applying those ideas by building real Generative AI applications. 

Throughout this course, we will be building our own Generative AI startup so you can get an understanding of what it takes to launch your ideas. 

Build a strong foundation of Generative AI knowledge and start applying it today!

## üìÇ Each lesson includes:
- optional supplemental video
- written lesson
- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- a challenge
- links 

## üå± Getting Started

To get started, [fork this entire repo](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/fork) to your own GitHub account to be able to change any code and complete the challenges. You can also [star (üåü) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) to find it easier later!  

This course is divided into 6 concept lessons and 6 coding lessons. The coding lessons have both a Juypter Notebook and README included if you only want to view the results of the code and text. To help you get up and running faster, we recommend using this course with Github Codespaces (no extra installs needed). You can open this by using the link below:
