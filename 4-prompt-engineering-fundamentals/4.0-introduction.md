## 4.1 Introduction

Our education startup is focused on ways in which we can [bring AI innovation to education](https://educationblog.microsoft.com/2023/06/collaborating-to-bring-ai-innovation-to-education) to support _administrators, educators and students_ with generative AI experiences. We're focusing on **personalized learning experiences** that can be activated with natural language (chat) interfaces so our users don't need any technical expertise to start using them. 


By now, we're familiar with these two terms:
 - **Generative AI** - is a category of artificial intelligence capable of _generating new content based on pre-trained models_ - in response to a natural language input or "prompt".
 - **Large Language Models (LLM)** - are a type of generative AI trained on massive quantities of text data to execute natural language processing (NLP) tasks at scale. 

In this lesson, we're going to introduce a third term - **Prompt Engineering** - that reflects a new field of engineering focused on _more effective prompt design_ with tools and techniques to guide LLMs to deliver more relevant and consistent results for our generative AI applications.
 - We'll define prompt engineering - and motivate the need to design better prompts.
 - We'll explore prompt usage with examples - and understand opportunities and limitations.
 - We'll explore design techniques - and iterate and validate prompts to meet expectations.


## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson we will be able to:
 - _Describe Prompt Engineering_ - what it is, and why it matters in generative AI apps.
 - _Analyze Prompt Examples_ - to understand best practices & limitations for prompt design.
 - _Apply Prompt Engineering Techniques_ - to iterate & validate prompts for response quality.
 - _Explore Prompt Engineering with OpenAI_ - using GitHub Codespaces & Jupyter Notebooks.

Once we get an understanding of prompt engineering fundamentals, we can then answer this question for our education startup:

_How can we engineer prompts to deliver a more reliable and consistent experience for our students, educators and adminstrators using our generative AI app?_
