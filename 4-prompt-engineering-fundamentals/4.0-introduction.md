<!--
GUIDING THEME:
This lesson should answer the question:
"If I were building an education AI startup, how would prompt-engineering help me?"

INTRODUCTION:
Identify 3 core concepts to teach.
Identify 3 learning goals to achieve.

CODE CHALLENGE:
If provided, should have an education focus - help show how the concepts can be applied to make the lives of teachers and students easier.

## Introduction

By now, you are familiar with these two terms:
 - **Generative AI** - is a category of artificial intelligence capable of _generating new content based on pre-trained models_ - in response to a natural language input or "prompt".
 - **Large Language Models (LLM)** - are a type of generative AI trained on massive quantities of text data to execute natural language processing (NLP) tasks at scale. 

In this lesson, we're going to introduce a third term - **Prompt Engineering** - that reflects a new field of engineering focused on _more effective prompt design_ with tools and techniques to guide LLMs to deliver more relevant and consistent results for our generative AI applications.
 - We'll define prompt engineering and motivate the need to design better prompts.
 - We'll explore prompt usage in real-world examples to understand opportunities and limitations.
 - We'll explore design techniques to help us iterate and validate prompts till they meet expectations.


## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson you will be able to:
 - Describe Prompt Engineering - what it is, and why it matters to generative AI apps.
 - Discuss Real-World Prompt Examples - illustrate their value and highlight their limitations.
 - Apply Prompt-Engineering Techniques - to iterate & validate responses till desired criteria is met.
 - Explore Prompt Engineering with OpenAI - using GitHub Codespaces, Jupyter Notebooks and OpenAI API key.

This will set the stage for you to explore more _advanced engineering techniques_ in the next lesson. It should also help you **apply these learnings** to your real-world application by answering this question:

> _How can better prompt engineering help me deliver an enhanced experience to students, educators, adminstrators and other user audiences, in my education startup_.
