# Building Generative AI-Powered Chat Applications

In the age of digitized communication, chat applications have become integrated into our daily lives, offering more than just a means of casual conversation.  They are integral parts of customer service, technical support, and even sophisticated advisory systems. It's likely that you've gotten some help from a chat application not too long ago. As we integrate more advanced technologies like generative AI into these platforms, the complexity increases and so does the challenges. How do we efficiently build and seamlessly integrate these AI-powered applications for specific use cases?  Once deployed, how can we monitor and ensure that the applications are operating at the highest level of quality, both in terms of functionality and adhering to the [six pillars of responsible AI]()?

As we move further into an age defined by automation and seamless human-machine interactions, understanding how generative AI transforms the scope, depth, and adaptability of chat applications becomes essential. This lesson will investigate the foundational architecture that supports these intricate systems, delve into the methodologies for fine-tuning them for domain-specific tasks, and evaluate the metrics and considerations pertinent to ensuring responsible AI deployment.

This lesson covers:
- Techniques for efficiently buliding and integerating chat applications.
- How to apply customization and fine tuning to applications.
- Strategies and considerations to effectively monitor high quality chat applications.

## Learning Goals 
By the end of this lesson, you will be:

- Equipped with the technical know-how to efficiently build and integrate chat applications into existing systems or as stand-alone platform.
- Possess the skills to customize chat applications for specific use-cases and understand how to fine-tune generative AI models for optimized performance and relevance.
- Identify key metrics and considerations to effectively monitor and maintain the quality of AI-powered chat applications, ensuring they meet or exceed operational and ethical standards.



##  Integrating Generative AI into Chat Applications



### Chatbot or Chat application?

It's easy to conflate terms like 'chatbots' and 'AI-powered chat applications,' but they serve distinct roles and functionalities. A chatbot's main purpose is to automate specific conversational tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions or tracking a package. It's typically governed by rule-based logic or complex AI algorithms. In contrast, an AI-powered chat application is a far more expansive environment designed to facilitate various forms of digital communication, such as text, voice, and video chats among human users. While it may host one or several chatbots for specialized tasks, its defining feature is the integration of generative AI model that simulate nuanced, human-like conversations, generating responses based on a wide variety of input and contextual cues. A generative AI powered chat applicaion can engage in open-domain discussions, adapt to evolving conversational contexts, and even produce creative or complex dialogue.

The table below outlines the key differences and similarities to help us understand their unique roles in digital communication.

| Chatbot                               | Generative AI-Powered Chat Application |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Task-Focused and rule based           | Dynamic, Context-Aware, & Versatile    |
| Limited to Programmed functions       | Hosts One or Multiple Chatbots         |
| Often Integrated into larger systems  | Incorporates Generative AI Models      |
| Specialized & structured interactions | Capable of Open-Domain Discussions     |
