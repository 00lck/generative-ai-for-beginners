## Learning Goals 

After completing this lesson you will know: 
- The importance of Responsible AI when building Generative AI applications. 
- When to think and apply the core principles of Responsible AI during your application building process. 
- What tools and strategies are available to you to put the concept of Responsible AI into practice. 


## Responsible AI Principles 

The excitement of Generative AI has never been higher. This excitement has brought a lot of new developers, attention and funding to this space. While this is very positive for anyone looking to build products and companies using Generative AI, it is also important we proceed responsibly. 

Throughout this course we are focusing on building our startup and our AI education product. Let's look at the principles of Responsible AI and how they relate to our use of Generative AI in our products. 


## Why Should You Prioritise Responsible AI 

When building product, taking a human centric approach by keeping your users best interest in mind leads to the best results. 

The uniqueness of Generative AI is its power to create helpful answers, information, guidance and content for users. This can be done without many manual steps which can lead to very impressive results. Without proper planning and strategies, it can also unfortunately lead to some harmful results both for your users, your product and society as a whole. 

Let's look at some (but not all) of these potentially harmful results: 

### Hallucinations 

Hallucinations are a term used to describe when an LLM produces content that is either completely nonsensical or something we know is factually wrong based on other sources of information. 

Let's take for example we build a feature for our startup that allows students to ask historical questions to a model. A student asks the question `Who was the sole surivor of Titanic?`

The model produces a a response like the one below:
