# Getting Started with "Generative AI for Beginners" 

We are very excited for you to start this course and see what you get inspired to build with Generative AI! 

To make your time successful, we have created this page that outlines any setup steps, technical requirements, and how to get help when you need it. 


## Setup Steps 


### 1. Fork this Repo

[Fork this entire repo](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/fork) to your own GitHub account to be able to change any code and complete the challenges. You can also [star (ðŸŒŸ) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) to find it and related repos easier. 


### 2. Create a Codespace 
To avoid any dependency issues when running the code, we recommend running this course in a GitHub codespace. 

This can be created by selecting the `Code` option on your forked version of this repo and selecting the `Codespaces` option.

### 3. Storing Your API Keys 
Keeping your API keys safe and secure is important when building any type of application. We encourage you not to store any API keys directly in the code you are working with as committing those details to a public repository could result in unwanted costs and issues. 

One of the best ways to keep your API keys secure when using GitHub Codespaces is by using Codespace Secrets. Please follow this guide on how to [manage secrets for your codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-your-codespaces/managing-secrets-for-your-codespaces). 


## Lessons and Technical Requirements 

The course has 6 concept lessons and 6 coding lessons. 

For the coding lessons, we are using the Azure OpenAI Service. You will need access to the Azure OpenAI service and an API key to run this code. You can apply to get access by [completing this application](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUOFA5Qk1UWDRBMjg0WFhPMkIzTzhKQ1dWNyQlQCN0PWcu&culture=en-us&country=us). 

While you wait for your application to be processed, each coding lesson also includes a `README.md` file where you can view the code and outputs.

## Using the Azure OpenAI Service for the First Time 

If this is your first time working with the Azure OpenAI service, please follow this guide on how to [create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal) 

## Meet Other Learners 

We have created channels in our official [AI Community Discord server](https://aka.ms/genai-discord) for meeting other learners. This is a great way to network with other like-minded entrepreneurs, builders, students, and anyone looking to level up in Generative AI.

The project team will also be on this Discord server to help any learners.
