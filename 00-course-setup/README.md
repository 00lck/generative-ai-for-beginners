# Getting Started with "Generative AI for Beginners" 

We are very excited for you to start this course and see what you get inspired to build with Generative AI! 

To make your time successful, we have created this page that outlines any setup steps, technical requirements and how to get help when you need it. 


## Setup Steps 


### 1. Fork this Repo

[Fork this entire repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to your own GitHub account to be able to change any code and complete the challenges. You can also [star (ðŸŒŸ) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) to find it and related repos easier. 


### 2. Create a Codespace 
To avoid any depenency issues when running the code, we reccomend running this course in a GitHub codespace. 

This can be created by selecting the `Code` option on your forked version of this repo and selecting the `Codespaces` option. 







### 3. Storing Your API Keys 




## Lessons and Technical Requriments 

The course has 6 concept lessons and 6 coding lessons. 

For the coding lessons, we are using the Azure OpenAI Service. You will need access to the Azure OpenAI service and an API key to run this code. You can apply to get access by [completing this appplication](https://customervoice.microsoft.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR7en2Ais5pxKtso_Pz4b1_xUOFA5Qk1UWDRBMjg0WFhPMkIzTzhKQ1dWNyQlQCN0PWcu&culture=en-us&country=us). 

While you wait for your application to be processed, each coding lesson also includes a `README.md` file where you can view the code and outputs.

### Setting Up Azure OpenAI Service for the First Time 



## Meet Other Learners 

We have created channels in our official [AI Community Discord server](https://aka.ms/genai-discord) for meeting other learners. This is a great way to create way to network with other like minded enterperneurs, builders, students and anyone looking to level up in Generative AI.
